Customer Analytics:

### INTRODUCTION

### A good understanding of  customers is extremely important for running a successful business.

### KYC (Know Your Customer) is what makes all the difference for many companies. 

### KYC helps businesses do their best in creating, communicating and delivering their offerings by

### tailoring them to their customer's needs. That is why Customer Analytic is the most important part

### of both Marketing Analytics and the Marketing function of a company in general.

### Customer Analytic seeks to understand customer's behavior and numerous performance 

### outcome indicators. 


### SCOPE:

### Although there are broad characterics to consider in Consumer Analytics, it is however

### more logical to focus on one of the fundamental marketing frameworks - Segmentation, Targeting

### and positioning known as the STP Framework. This Framework is chosen because it applies to all areas  

### of business and marketing activity. However, in this notebook I dived into Customer Segmentation. 

### My second notebook will dive into Positioning as, those two would help to determine the targeting.


### DATA SOURCE

### The dataset  I used is a B2C business model. They are gotten from individual people that shoped in a 

### a certain Supermarket(name withheld). A Supermarket is a perfect datapoint from a data science 

### Customer Analytic point because different kinds of people makr their purchase on a daily basis, 

### therefore there is lots of varaible data available.



### I hope you enjoy the analysis. Attached are comments for clarifications when need be.
